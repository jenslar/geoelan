# 200125
- Initial release
## Known issues and comments
- General
    - Some reduntant + duplicated code, either to be moved, removed or restructured.
    - Does not support chained FIT-files (will presumably just read the first 'file'): "If you open your test file in a hex/text editor you should see a second file header with the ".FIT" signature in it."
- `eaf2geo`
    - currently requires specifying FIT-file (should be easily accessible in the output dir)
        - Not yet setting automatically via MP4 FIT metadata if present (generated by `cam2eaf`)
        - Not yet setting automatically via EAF-header if present in `<PROPERTY>`.
- `manual`
    - Viewing the plain-text manual via `geoelan manual` results in very long lines for some Asciidoc box ornamnets. This is from converting from Asciidoc -> HTML -> plain-text. (`asciidoctor` + `pandoc`)
- Windows build
    - UNC paths, Rust and ELAN
        - `canonicalize()` produces [UNC paths](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-dfsc/149a3039-98ce-491a-9268-2f5ddef08192) on Windows: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/42869>
        - When writing paths as strings into an ELAN-file, the prefix `\\?` causes issues.
        - In-memory paths while running GeoELAN works fine on Windows so far.
        - Hacky workaround via `trim_start_matches(r"\\?")`, but...
        - ...UNC path prefixes may have further content in place of `?` so a more general solution is required.
