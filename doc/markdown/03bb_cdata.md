### The 'cdata' option

The `--cdata` option only affects KML-files. It will insert extra information into the KML-file in the form of HTML inside the `<description>` element for each point (see the [CDATA section in Google's KML documentation](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kml_tut)). In Google Earth this results in an information bubble to pop up when a point is clicked on, as a visual flair for e.g. presentations.
