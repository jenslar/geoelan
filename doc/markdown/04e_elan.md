## ELAN

[ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan) is a completely free, advanced tool for time-aligned annotations of audiovisual media developed by the [The Language Archive](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/), Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen.

While it is well-known in academia, and particularly in the humanities for transcribing recordings, its use goes well beyond this, since anything observed can be annotated, and thus time-aligned. Annotations are multi-layered, and kept aligned in parallel on separate tiers, similar to multi-track audio editors.

The [ELAN Annotation Format](https://www.mpi.nl/tools/elan/EAF_Annotation_Format_3.0_and_ELAN.pdf) is XML-based which makes it both human-readable and fairly straightforward to parse.
