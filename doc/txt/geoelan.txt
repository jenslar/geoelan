Introduction

GeoELAN is a command-line tool that geo-references time-aligned
text-annotations of observed phenomena in audiovisual recordings,
captured with a recent GoPro or Garmin VIRB action camera, see Larsson
et al 2021. In other words, GeoELAN is used for annotating action camera
GPS logs with the help of ELAN.

By annotating a section representing an on-site utterance, a plant that
is in view, or anything else that was captured, the annotation can be
automatically linked to the corresponding coordinates. The nature of the
workflow also means consultants not physically present at the the time
of recording may evaluate observed phenomena to be geo-referenced
post-collection. As the name implies, the free ELAN annotation software
plays a central role and is required to annotate events. The final
output can be points, polylines, or polygons (circles), in the form of
annotated KML and GeoJSON-files. Henceforth, "GoPro" refers to a GoPro
Hero 5 Black or later, and "VIRB" to the Garmin VIRB Ultra 30. Note that
while GeoELAN functionality differs slightly between Garmin and GoPro
due to differences in formats and file structure, the general workflow
and the final output are the same.

  Note that the Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 is no longer produced, so use a
  recent GoPro instead. We, and maybe others, still have and use VIRBs,
  so GeoELAN will continue to support these.

  GeoELAN is multi-functional tool that can

  -   geo-reference ELAN-annotations of GoPro and VIRB footage (i.e.
      annotate GPS logs) and generate annotated points, lines, or
      circles.
  -   inspect the content of your GoPro GPMF data, or Garmin FIT-files.
  -   locate and match all relevant files belonging to the same
      recording session (clips, telemetry-files).
  -   automatically concatenate clips for a specific recording, and
      generate an ELAN-file with linked media.

Requirements

-   An action camera with a built-in GPS. Supported devices are:
    -   GoPro Hero Black 5 or newer (Max, and Fusion cameras have not
        been tested)
    -   Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 (documentation)
-   ELAN (documentation)
-   FFmpeg (for concatenating video)
-   Rust toolchain (optional, only required for compiling GeoELAN from
    source)

Installation

-   Download the zip-file from https://github.com/jenslar/geoelan or use
    git clone https://github.com/jenslar/geoelan.git.
-   See the bin directory for pre-compiled executables for Linux, macOS,
    and Windows.

Compile and install from source

You can also compile GeoELAN from source. Depending on your operating
system, this may require installing additional software, and some
understanding of working in a terminal. The basic steps are:

1.  Install the Rust programming language
2.  Get the GeoELAN source from https://github.com/jenslar/geoelan
3.  cd geoelan (you should be in the folder containing Cargo.toml)
4.  cargo build --release
5.  cargo install --path . (optional, makes geoelan a global command)

Before you start

Practical advice

-   Keep the original files! GeoELAN can only work with unedited files,
    since these contain unique identifiers used for synchronisation
    and/or telemetry, including the GPS-log. Converting videos to make
    them smaller will discard both identifiers and telemetry. GeoELAN
    will use low-resolution footage by default anyway, and the
    high-resolution footage can be ignored via the --low-res-only flag
    for cam2eaf.
-   All VIRB telemetry, such as the GPS-log, is stored as a separate
    file. Keep all files on the microSD, unless you are absolutely
    certain which files are relevant.

Running GeoELAN

-   GeoELAN is a command line tool and has no graphical user interface.
-   FFmpeg is required to concatenate clips. (cam2eaf)
-   If you use macOS and GeoELAN does not run, see
    https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491.

Device compatibility

-   Garmin: Only VIRB Ultra 30 has been tested extensively, but earlier
    VIRB models may still work.
-   GoPro: Only "main line" Hero cameras with GPS have been tested, but
    Max and Fusion cameras may still work.

GPS

Make sure the GPS is turned on and has acquired a satellite lock. This
may take a couple of minutes or longer, especially if you have not used
the camera for a while or have traveled far between uses.

Verifying a satellite lock:

-   For VIRB, the GPS-icon should be steady, not blinking (it may log
    coordinates while the icon is still blinking, but do not rely on
    this being the norm).
-   For GoPro, the GPS-icon should be white, not gray.

  It may be difficult to acquire a satellite lock and/or reliably log
  position in areas with heavy overhead vegetation or dense cities with
  very tall buildings. Using a headstrap, instead of a cheststrap
  sometimes helps.

GPS logging behaviour:

-   GoPro logs dummy coordinates if no lock has been acquired. GeoELAN
    will not use these.
    -   Verify lock by running: geoelan i -g GH010006.MP4 --gps which
        will list number of bad points.
-   VIRB does not log position at all until a lock has been acquired.

Annotating in ELAN

-   It is best to limit each kind of observed phenomena you wish to
    geo-reference to a single ELAN-tier, so...
-   ...to keep e.g. place names and plant sightings within the same
    ELAN-file make a separate tier for each (see the example walkthrough
    in the next section). Then you can just re-run GeoELAN on the same
    ELAN-file and select another tier to geo-reference along with other
    output options.

Example walkthrough

This section describes how GeoELAN can be used to geo-reference
ELAN-annotations. Please refer to the detailed sections if you get
stuck. Note that all input video clips must be the unprocessed, original
MP4 (GoPro + VIRB) and FIT-files (VIRB). The so-called FIT-files
mentioned throughout this manual are where the VIRB logs GPS-data and
other kinds of telemetry during a recording session. These need to be
matched to the corresponding video recording (see The FIT-format and the
Garmin VIRB for further information). GeoELAN will help with all of
this, with the exception of annotating your data.

As noted below, some of the commands differ slightly between GoPro and
VIRB due to differences in file and data structures.

The basic steps are:

1.  Record video with a recent GoPro or Garmin VIRB action camera.
2.  Use GeoELAN to concatenate the video clips and generate an
    ELAN-file.
3.  Annotate spatially interesting sections in ELAN.
4.  Use GeoELAN to geo-reference the annotations, resulting in annotated
    KML and GeoJSON files.

Input files

VIRB

-   VIRB0001-1.MP4, any clip in a recording session (remaining clips
    located automatically)
-   FIT-file with corresponding GPS-data (located automatically)

GoPro

-   GH010026.MP4, any clip in a recording session (remaining clips
    located automatically)

Output files

VIRB + GoPro

-   KML and GeoJSON files with ELAN annotation content synchronised and
    mapped to the corresponding points as descriptions. See the command
    eaf2geo for other options.

Step 1/3: Generate an ELAN-file with linked media files

In step 1 we will locate all video clips (GoPro + VIRB) and FIT-files
(VIRB) that belong to a specific recording session, process these, and
generate an ELAN-file with linked media files.

VIRB

Command

    geoelan virb2eaf --video INDIR/VIRB0001-1.MP4 --indir INDIR/ --outdir OUTDIR/

Output files

    OUTDIR/VIRB0001-1/
    ├── VIRB0001-1.mp4     High-resolution video (concatenated)
    ├── VIRB0001-1_LO.mp4  Low-resolution video for ELAN (concatenated)
    ├── VIRB0001-1.wav     Extracted audio for ELAN (concatenated)
    ├── VIRB0001-1.eaf     ELAN-file with pre-linked media files
    ├── VIRB0001-1.kml     Overview KML-file with all points logged during the recording session
    └── VIRB0001-1.txt     FFmpeg concatenation file, paths to input clips

GoPro

Command

    geoelan gopro2eaf --video INDIR/GH010026.MP4 --indir INDIR/ --outdir OUTDIR/

Output files

    OUTDIR/GH010026/
    ├── GH010026.mp4     High-resolution video (concatenated)
    ├── GH010026_LO.mp4  Low-resolution video for ELAN (concatenated)
    ├── GH010026.wav     Extracted audio for ELAN (concatenated)
    ├── GH010026.eaf     ELAN-file with pre-linked media files
    ├── GH010026.kml     Overview KML-file with all points logged during the recording session
    └── GH010026.txt     FFmpeg concatenation file, paths to input clips

Explanation of the command

GeoELAN locates and concatenates all clips for the recording session the
clip VIRB0001-1.MP4/GH010026.MP4 is part of, then generates an ELAN-file
with linked media files.

The relevant sub-commands are virb2eaf/gopro2eaf, depending on camera.

By specifying any clip in the recording session via --video, the
remaining clips (GoPro + VIRB), including the corresponding FIT-file
(VIRB), will be automatically located if they exist in the specified
input directory (--indir). Sub-directories will be searched as well. The
result, including the corresponding FIT-file for VIRB cameras, will be
saved to the specified outout directory (--outdir).

If low-resolution clips (.GLV/.LRV) are located, a concatenated
low-resolution video will be linked in the ELAN-file. If not, the
concatenated high-resolution video will be linked instead.

GeoELAN defaults to not insert a tier with geo-data in the ELAN-file due
to the effect this may have on performance. To do so, use the --geotier
flag (see Geo-data in ELAN).

  TIP: For longer recording sessions, resulting in many video clips,
  step 1 is usually much faster if --indir and --outdir is not on the
  same physical hard drive. Those with an SSD (standard on most modern
  laptops) should be fine running step 1. on a single drive however.

Step 2/3: Annotate events in ELAN

Next, ELAN is used with the ELAN-file from step 1 to annotate events
that should be geo-referenced in step 3. Feel free to create any tier
structure you may need. Tokenized tiers can not be geo-referenced, but
otherwise any tier is fine, including deeply nested, referred tiers.

GeoELAN will geo-reference annotations from a single tier (selectable in
step 3). Thus, if you want to generate a KML-file with e.g. indigenous
place names mentioned on-site during the recording, those place names
must be limited to a single tier. If there are other spatial categories
or groupings you wish to explore, simply create a new tier for each. In
step 3 you can then re-run GeoELAN as many times as required, then
select a different tier and/or options on each run.

When the annotations are geo-referenced in step 3, the annotation values
in the selected tier will be used as descriptions for the synchronized,
corresponding points in the KML and GeoJSON-files. Points corresponding
to unannotated sections of the ELAN-file will either be discarded or
have no description, depending on which options you use in step 3.

An annotated event can relate to anything observed in the recording and
can be represented as either points or polylines in the output KML-file.
If you are unsure which best applies to what you have in mind for your
data, or how this may affect how you annotate, here are a few ideas for
each kind.

  Points could concern documenting:

  -   the location of a plant or a geographical feature, e.g. annotate
      the timespan either is visible in the video.
  -   an uttered place name or an animal cry, e.g. annotate the timespan
      it is uttered or heard on-site.

  For these specific cases, the exact time spans of the annotations are
  not that important. It should be enough to ensure the annotation lasts
  for the duration of the place name being uttered, or for as long as
  the plant is visible. If unsure, add a another second to the
  annotation timespan. An average coordinate will be calculated for
  those that were logged within each annotation's time span, so as long
  as the camera wearer does not stray too far from the observation
  point, the result should be accurate enough.

  Lines could concern documenting:

  -   various types of movement through the landscape. To annotate the
      movement of "walking up-hill" as it is observed visually in the
      recording set the annotation's start time at the bottom of the
      hill and its end at the top, or for as long as the motion can be
      observed.
  -   a narrative reflecting on the immediate surroundings as they
      change over time. E.g. comments on visible landscape features, or
      perhaps the re-construction of an historical event as it unfolded
      over space and time.

Step 3/3: Generate a KML-file from geo-referenced ELAN annotations

Now that we have a few annotations, GeoELAN will geo-referenence these
by determining which points were logged within each annotation's
timespan. Note the different commands between GoPro and VIRB.

This is where you choose the approriate geographical representations for
your annotated phenomena. Here are suggestions for the examples in step
2.

  Points:

  -   the location of a plant or a geographical feature
  -   an uttered place name or an animal cry

  To get a single, average coordinate for each annotation in the KML and
  GeoJSON-files, use the --geoshape point-single option.

  Lines:

  -   types of movement through the landscape
  -   narrative reflecting on the immediate surroundings

  Two line options may apply to the above. To get a continuous polyline
  alternating between marked (annotated) and unmarked (un-annotated)
  events, use the option --geoshape line-all. To get a broken-up
  polyline representing marked events only, use the option
  --geoshape line-multi.

There are other options, such as circle output. It is similar to point
output, for which radius and height can be specified (all circles will
have the same size). For a more detailed overview of the possibilities,
see the --geoshape option for the command eaf2geo. Experiment! If you
realise one representation is not appropriate after all, re-run GeoELAN
with a different option.

VIRB

Command

    geoelan eaf2geo --eaf VIRB0001-1.eaf --fit 2003-01-02-12-00-00.fit --geoshape point-single

Output files

    OUTDIR/VIRB0001-1/
    ├── ...                              Existing files
    ├── VIRB0001-1_point-single.kml      New KML-file, one point per annotation in the selected tier

GoPro

Command

    geoelan eaf2geo --eaf GH010026.eaf --gpmf INDIR/GH010026.MP4  --geoshape point-single

  Important: GH010026.MP4 must be the original video generated by the
  camera, indicated by INDIR from step 1/3.

Output files

    OUTDIR/GH010026/
    ├── ...                            Existing files
    ├── GH010026_point-single.kml      New KML-file, one point per annotation in the selected tier
    └── GH010026_point-single.geojson  New GeoJSON-file, one point per annotation in the selected tier

Explanation of the command

GeoELAN geo-references all annotations in a single ELAN-tier (selectable
from a list) for the specified ELAN-file, then generates annotated KML
and GeoJSON files where each point represents a single annotation.

The relevant sub-command is eaf2geo. By specifying an ELAN-file (--eaf)
and the corresponding GoPro MP4-file (--gpmf) or VIRB FIT-file (--fit),
GeoELAN will synchronise the annotations with the coordinates contained
within the MP4/FIT-file.

--geoshape point-single lets GeoELAN know that each, respective
annotation should be distilled into a single point, meaning that the
generated KML-file will contain as many points as there are annotations
in the selected tier. Each point inherits the corresponding annotation
value as its description. The KML-file is named according to the
selected --geoshape option, in this case
VIRB0001-1_point-single.kml/GH010026_point-single.kml.

For the example command for VIRB, the user will be presented with a list
of recording sessions present in the FIT-file (see The FIT-format and
the Garmin VIRB). GoPro MP4-files lack the appropriate metadata to
display such as list.

Commands

There are six commands:

   Command   Alias  Description
  --------- ------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
   cam2eaf    g2e   Generate an ELAN-file, and link concatenated media files
   eaf2geo    e2g   Geo-reference ELAN-annotations and generate annotated KML/GeoJSON
   locate      l    Locate and match video clips and/or FIT-files
   inspect     i    Inspect the contents of a GoPro MP4-file or any Garmin FIT-file
   manual      m    View or save this manual to disk

To see help for a specific command, run geoelan <COMMAND> --help.

The most relevant commands are probably cam2eaf and eaf2geo. locate is
there to help with locating and matching video clips and/or FIT-files
that belong to the same recording session, but this functionality partly
exists in cam2eaf as well. inspect will print the data contents of a
GoPro MP4/Garmin FIT-file, but will do so in an unprocessed form. It is
intended more as a technical aid for troubleshooting or to verify the
contents of MP4/FIT-files. manual is for viewing or saving the full
manual.

Time adjustment with --time-offset

If the action camera has not adjusted for the current time zone, several
commands have a --time-offset option. It takes a +/- value in hours that
will be applied to all timestamps in the output, e.g. --time-offset 7
will add seven hours to all timestamps.

Reducing the number of coordinates with --downsample

For the commands cam2eaf, and eaf2geo, the output may contain
coordinates in some form (a KML/GeoJSON-file or as annotations in an
ELAN-file). Since the VIRB GPS logs at 10Hz, the resulting files may
become too heavy to work with in some cases, such as loading a KML-file
in Google Earth. GoPro logs at 10 or 18Hz depending on model, but saves
points as a cluster each second. Since it is only the cluster that gets
timestamped, and not the individual points, GeoELAN averages these to a
single, timestamped point at the same interval the cluster was
originally logged (roughly once/second).

--downsample can be used for both ELAN and KML/GeoJSON output to reduce
the number of coordinates that are imported/exported. It is especially
advised for KML-files that are to be loaded into Google Earth, since a 2
hour VIRB recording may contain more than 70 000 logged points.
--downsample takes a positive numerical value that is effectively a
divisor: --downsample 10 means an average coordinate will be calculated
for every cluster of 10 points. For 70 000 logged points, a value of 100
means the output will contain 700 points and so on. If the user sets
--downsample to a value that exceeds the total number of points logged
by the GPS, it will be changed to the largest applicable value
(resulting in a single point for the entire recording as opposed to none
at all). Extreme values may also affect the result in unexpected ways,
depending on gaps in the GPS-data.

If 'cam2eaf' or 'eaf2geo' return errors

Try the inspect command on problematic MP4/FIT-files. This way you can
verify whether points were actually logged or not. If the file is
corrupt the error message will also be printed.

FFmpeg

For the command cam2eaf FFmpeg is required. If you intend to use the
static build for FFmpeg as described in the appendix under FFmpeg, point
to it using --ffmpeg PATH/TO/FFMPEG/ffmpeg (ffmpeg.exe on Windows). If
the --ffmpeg option is not used, geoelan will assume ffmpeg is available
as a global command and complain accordingly if it is not.

  TIP: GeoELAN will never overwrite existing files without permission.
  Should you accidentally delete the generated ELAN-file with the output
  media files intact, just re-run the cam2eaf command. It will
  automatically skip concatenating videos, but still generate a new
  ELAN-file.

  TIP: In the tables for the respective command sections, arguments
  listed under 'Flags' do not take a value, whereas those listed under
  'Options' do. If a default value is listed, it will be automatically
  set, unless the user specifies otherwise.

cam2eaf

  -   Camera model: GoPro, VIRB
  -   Command/alias: cam2eaf / c2e
  -   Help: geoelan cam2eaf --help
  -   Basic usage:
      geoelan cam2eaf --indir INDIR/ --video GH010006.MP4 --outdir OUTDIR/

cam2eaf generates an ELAN-file with pre-linked media files. All clips in
the specified recording session will be automatically located, grouped,
and concatenated. A WAV-file from the full video is also extracted. By
default the low-resolution footage is used (if found), use the
--link-high-res flag to link the high-resolution footage. The
corresponding coordinates can optionally be added a tier.

Note that the --fit and --uuid parameters are only valid for VIRB.

Flags

   Short  Long              Description
  ------- ----------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------
          --fullgps         Use the full-res GPS log for the ELAN geotier
          --dryrun          Show results but do not process or copy files
          --geotier         Insert tier with synchronised coordinates in ELAN-file
          --link-high-res   Link high-resolution video in ELAN-file
    -l    --low-res-only    Only concatenate low-res clips (.LRV/.GLV), ignores high-res clips

Examples GoPro

GoPro Example 1

  --------- --------- ----------------- ----------------- ------------------ ------------------------
   geoelan   cam2eaf   -v GH010026.MP4      -i INDIR/         -o OUTDIR/            --geotier
             command   clip in session   input directory   output directory   insert coordinate tier
  --------- --------- ----------------- ----------------- ------------------ ------------------------

Result: Locates all clips for the recording session containing the clip
GH010026.MP4 (-g) in the input directory INDIR/ (-i). These will be
concatenated, and the audio track exported as a WAV for use in ELAN. The
resulting files are then copied to the output directory OUTDIR/ (-o).
The generated ELAN-file will also have synchronised coordinates inserted
as a tier (--geotier).

Examples VIRB

  Note: Recording session can be specified using one of --fit, --uuid,
  --video. These options are mutually exclusive. --fit returns a list of
  sessions present in the FIT-file, from which the user can select the
  relevant one. --uuid and --video require no further user input.

  Note: Using --fullgps together with --geotier will result in very
  large ELAN-files. Additionally, trying to edit the 'geotier' may make
  ELAN sluggish or unsresponsive.

VIRB Example 1

  --------- --------- ------------------- ----------------- ------------------ ------------------------
   geoelan   cam2eaf   -v VIRB0001-1.MP4      -i INDIR/         -o OUTDIR/            --geotier
             command    clip in session    input directory   output directory   insert coordinate tier
  --------- --------- ------------------- ----------------- ------------------ ------------------------

Result: Locates all clips for the recording session containing the clip
VIRB0001-1.MP4 (-v) in the input directory INDIR/ (-i). These will be
concatenated, and the audio track exported as a WAV for use in ELAN. The
resulting files are then copied together with the corresponding FIT-file
to the output directory OUTDIR/ (-o). The generated ELAN-file will also
have synchronised coordinates inserted as a tier (--geotier).

VIRB Example 2

  --------- --------- ---------------------------- ----------------- ------------------ -------------------------------
   geoelan   cam2eaf   -f 2017-01-28-05-16-40.FIT      -i INDIR/         -o OUTDIR/             --low-res-only
             command            FIT-file            input directory   output directory   do not concatenate hi-res MP4
  --------- --------- ---------------------------- ----------------- ------------------ -------------------------------

Result: The relevant recording session is specified via the FIT-file
2017-01-28-05-16-40.fit (-f). This presents the user with a list of
sessions to select from, which allows GeoELAN to locate matching clips
in the input directory INDIR/ (-i). Only the low-resolution clips
(--low-res-only) will be concatenated. All resulting files are then
copied together with the corresponding FIT-file to the output directory
OUTDIR/ (-o).

  Tip: If you are unsure of the whereabouts of the FIT-file, make the
  search wider. Specifying the root of an external hard drive as input
  directory (--indir) will make the search process take slightly longer,
  but should work well. Otherwise, just specify the FIT-file separately
  (--fit), which can be useful if it is located outside of the input
  directory.

eaf2geo

  -   Camera model: GoPro, VIRB
  -   Command/alias: eaf2geo / e2g
  -   Help: geoelan eaf2geo --help
  -   Basic usage:
      geoelan eaf2geo --eaf VIRB0001-1.eaf --fit 2017-01-28-05-16-40.fit

eaf2geo generates KML and GeoJSON files by geo-referencing all
annotations in the specified tier. The user is presented with a list of
tier names to select from. Referred tiers are fine, but tokenized tiers
can not be used, since these lack time stamps. Several output options
exist via the --geoshape option, such as points or polylines (see
below). In the resulting KML and GeoJSON files, any point that
intersects with an annotation's timespan will inherit the annotation
value as a description.

  --------- --------- ------------------------- ----------------- ---------------------

Result: Geo-references annotations in the ELAN-file GH010026.eaf (-e)
and generates KML and GeoJSON files with a continous poly-line,
alternating between marked (annotated) and unmarked (un-annotated)
sections (--geoshape line-all).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2

  --------- --------- ---------------------------- ------------------- -------------------------
   geoelan   eaf2geo   -f 2017-01-28-05-16-40.fit   -e VIRB0001-1.eaf   --geoshape point-single
             command            FIT-file                ELAN-file            output option
  --------- --------- ---------------------------- ------------------- -------------------------

Result: Geo-references annotations in the ELAN-file VIRB0001-1.eaf (-e)
and generates KML and GeoJSON files with a single point per annotation
(--geoshape point-single). Since no video is specified (i.e. the first
clip in the recording session), the user will be presented with a list
of UUIDs in the specified FIT-file 2017-01-28-05-16-40.fit (-f) to
choose from, each representing the first clip in a recording session.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The geoshape option

Different geographical representations can be generated, including
points and lines. Six possible --geoshape values are accepted:

      Option     Description
  -------------- ------------------------------------------------------------
    point-all    All logged points exported (default if no option passed)
   point-multi   Exported points correspond to marked/annotated events only
   point-single  A single, averaged point for each annotation
     line-all    Polyline from all logged points
    line-multi   Polyline, corresponds to marked/annotated events only
    circle-2d    2D polygon, corresponds to marked/annotated events only
    circle-3d    3D polygon, corresponds to marked/annotated events only

--downsample can be used with all these options, but will be ignored for
point-single, circle-2d/circle-3d allows for further customisation, such
as height (circle-3d, KML-only) and radius. The circle options work in
the same way as point-single and are currently only a visual flair,
since radius and height are not yet derived from ELAN annotation values.

point-all

All points logged during the recording session will be exported. Any
point that intersects with the time span of an annotation will inherit
the annotation value as the coordinate description. Points that do not,
will have no description.

point-multi

Only points that intersect with the time span of an annotation will be
exported and will inherit the annotation text as the coordinate
description. Points that have no corresponding annotation will be
discarded. Useful for including points corresponding to marked events
only.

point-single

Only points that intersect with the time span of an annotation will be
considered for export. The difference to point-multi is that each
annotation will only generate a single point: an average of those logged
within the annotation's time span. Note that a custom --downsample value
will be ignored for point-single since it may affect the result
negatively. --downsample also has little use here, since the number of
points in the output will not be affected and will be quite low compared
to the other options. Useful for distilling marked events, such as place
names, to a single point for each event.

line-all

All points logged during the recording session will be exported,
resulting in a continuous polyline. Sub-sections that intersect with an
annotation inherit the annotation value as a description, whereas those
that do not will have no description.

circle-2d, circle-3d

circle-2d, and circle-3d work almost exactly like point-single with the
difference that a circle is generated around the calculated average
point. It is mostly a visual flair and its shape is currently not
affected by annotation values. circle-2d is flat against the ground,
whereas circle-3d can take a height value to become a cylindrical 3D
shape (only applies to KML, not GeoJSON). If circle output is specified,
three more options become available:

     Option    Description                                                     Default
  ------------ --------------------------------------------------------------- ---------
    --height   Height relative to ground in meters (circle-3d)                 
    --radius   Radius in meters (circle-2d, circle-3d)                         2.0
   --vertices  Roundness, valid range 3 - 255 (3 will literally be triangle)   40

The 'cdata' option

Only affects KML-files. Using --cdata will insert extra information into
the KML-file in the form of HTML inside the <description> element for
each point (see the CDATA section in Google's KML documentation). This
will cause an information bubble to pop-up in Google Earth when a point
is clicked on, as a visual flair for e.g. presentations.

locate

  -   Camera model: GoPro, VIRB
  -   Command/alias: locate / l
  -   Help: geoelan locate --help
  -   Basic usage: geoelan locate --indir INDIR/ --kind gopro

locate will locate and match original GoPro and VIRB clips in the input
path. For VIRB, corresponding FIT-file/s will also be matched. By
optionally specifying a UUID (--uuid, --fit) or a clip (--video) in a
specific session, only paths for the files in that recording session
will be returned. If you are unsure of the location of all VIRB-files,
use an input path closer to the root, such as the root of an external
hard drive. If duplicate files are found, only the first one encountered
will be reported.

Result: Locates all GoPro clips in INDIR/ (-i) and groups them in
recording sessions.

  --------- ------------- ------------------ -----------------------

Result: Camera brand is detected automatically (in this case VIRB).
Locates all clips in INDIR/ (-i) for the recording session that contains
VIRB0001-1.MP4 (-v) together with the corresponding FIT-file.

inspect

  -   Camera model: GoPro, VIRB
  -   Command/alias: inspect / i
  -   Help: geoelan inspect --help

      -   VIRB: geoelan inspect --fit 2017-01-28-05-16-40.fit

inspect prints an overview or the detailed contents of a GoPro MP4 or a
Garmin FIT-file. If a Garmin VIRB MP4 is passed with no other options,
the embedded UUID will be printed. Options include filtering to print
only a sub-set of the data, such as GPS-data only, data corresponding to
a specific recording session, or both. locate is more of a technical aid
to, for example, verify that the GPS really did log coordinates. KML or
GeoJSON files can also be generated.

    -s    --session   [VIRB] Select session from a list. GoPro: Merges session data.

Note that the --offsets flag can only be used if the GoPro MP4-file was
specified via the --gpmf option below. It has no use for other
MP4-files.

    -v    --video   MP4-file                            

Note that --type takes a string for GoPro and a numerical identifier for
VIRB. --video accepts any MP4-file. See the sections below.

Inspecting telemetry

inspect will mostly print raw values that require further processing to
be of use. The exact nature of this data differs between GoPro and
Garmin. For GPS data, the flag --gps can be used for either device to
print a processed GPS-log showing coordinates in decimal degrees etc.
The other GeoELAN commands, such as eaf2geo, always convert data to the
relevant forms.

If a GoPro MP4 or a Garmin FIT-file can not be properly parsed, GeoELAN
will often return an error message that may hint at the issue. Try
inspect on files that raise errors with the other commands.

GoPro

GoPro cameras log and embed all telemetry within the MP4-files. In
contrast to Garmin FIT, data types have no numerical identifier (see
below) so internal text descriptions are used instead. GPS is identified
as "GPS (Lat., Long., Alt., 2D speed, 3D speed)", for example.

To list all data types logged in a GoPro MP4-file, run:

    geoelan inspect --gpmf GOPROVIDEO.MP4

This will list all data streams (DEVC is an internal container of sorts

Find the data type you wish to inspect further in the list. To print GPS
data in its "raw" form, run:

    geoelan inspect --gpmf GOPROVIDEO.MP4 --type "GPS (Lat., Long., Alt., 2D speed, 3D speed)"

Note the citation marks. These are necessary to pass the description as
a single string to GeoELAN. Your terminal shell may otherwise try to
interpret anything delimited by space as a command or a parameter, which
will fail. Unlike FIT, GPMF has no numerical identifier for data types.

GPS specifically, can be printed in a more conventional form via the
flag --gps:

    geoelan inspect --gpmf GOPROVIDEO.MP4 --gps

Generate a KML-file with:

    geoelan inspect --gpmf GOPROVIDEO.MP4 --kml

DEVC byte offsets

To list the byte offsets for GPMF DEVC containers (these hold raw GPMF
data), run:

    geoelan inspect --gpmf GOPROVIDEO.MP4 --offsets

This returns a table listing byte offset in the MP4-file (@XXXXX),
container size, and duration covered in milliseconds e.g.:

    DEVC @332392   size: 4836   duration: 1001ms
    DEVC @681939   size: 4840   duration: 1001ms
    DEVC @1037851  size: 4904   duration: 1001ms
    DEVC @1326489  size: 4924   duration: 1001ms

Images

Original GoPro JPEG-images can also be inspected. These will contain
much less GPMF data than the MP4-files, and are currently not used
elsewhere in GeoELAN's workflow. If no named data shows up in the
summary, try geoelan inspect --gpmf GOPROIMAGE.JPG --verbose to print
the raw data. Early GoPro models do not embed GPMF data in JPEG-images.

Garmin FIT

The FIT-format is quite different to GoPro's GPMF, apart from being a
separate file. There is among other things, additional information about
VIRB recording sessions. The VIRB starts logging to a FIT-file the
moment the camera is turned on, and only stops when it is turned off.
This means that a single FIT-file may contain data for multiple
recording sessions. Data is logged continuously - even between
recordings.

Inside a FIT-file, data is identified by a numerical identifier. For
example, GPS data is 160, also referred to as gps_metadata in the FIT
Software Development Kit (FIT SDK). inspect lists both identifiers in
the summary table.

To list all data types logged in a VIRB FIT-file, run:

    geoelan inspect --fit FITFILE.FIT

This will return a table:

     Global ID | Message type                 | Count

Find the data type you wish to inspect further in the list and take note
note of the "Global ID". To print GPS data in its "raw" form, run:

    geoelan inspect --fit FITFILE.FIT --type 160

GPS specifically, can be printed in a more conventional form via the
flag --gps:

    geoelan inspect --fit FITFILE.FIT --gps

Generate a KML-file with:

    geoelan inspect --fit FITFILE.FIT --kml

To print a single type of data belonging to a specific recording session
(VIRB only) use --session:

    geoelan inspect --fit FITFILE.FIT --type 160 --session

This will return a table listing all VIRB recording sessions together
with an input prompt (UUIDs shortened to fit):

     Session | Clips | First UUID in session

    ............................................................................................
    Select session:

Type the number in the "Session" column for the relevant session and
press enter. The output will now be limited to the selected recording
session, which also applies when generating KML/GeoJSON-files.

You could also specify an original VIRB video via --video, or a UUID
directly (any UUID in the session) via --uuid to achieve the same
result.

To find out the embedded UUID of a VIRB MP4-file, run:

    geoelan inspect --video VIRBVIDEO.MP4

This will return the embedded UUID:

    UUID: VIRBactioncameraULTRA30_Expansive_1920_1440_29.9700_3937280306_3af2a648_1_299_2021-05-03-14-23-23.fit

Most FIT-files, from e.g. watches, bike computers, will work with
inspect. Custom developer data is also supported. However some FIT
features are exclusive to VIRB, such as UUID and selecting sessions, and
other features are not implemented, such as compressed timestamp
headers. In such cases, the tool will report the error and exit. Missing
features may or may not be implemented in future versions.

  Tip: For those who wish to dig deeper, the Garmin FIT Software
  Development Kit contains a spreadsheet, Profile.xlsx, which lists the
  kinds of data a FIT-file may contain. Not all of those apply to every
  device however, and undocumented data types exist.

Video/MP4-files

MP4-files have a few options, besides inspecting embedded GoPro GPMF
data. Access these by using the --video option.

The --meta flag will show raw (i.e. bytes) content for the so-called
udta atom for any MP4-file. GoPro also embeds undocumented GPMF data in
the udta atom which will also be listed, whereas Garmin logs a unique
identifier here. The --atoms flag will show the MP4 atom hierarchy. To
most users these will not be of much use, but may provide technical
context for troubleshooting. If --atoms is not enough, try the command
line tool AtomicParsley.

For example, for a GoPro video run:

    geoelan inspect --video GOPROVIDEO.MP4

This returns:

    Identified as GoPro MP4 file with MUID:
    [2509914837, 3557475640, 2388862468, 1050529312, 132486099, 723984, 3197894656, 0]
    To inspect GPMF run 'geoelan inspect --gpmf GOPROVIDEO.MP4'

Then try:

    geoelan inspect --video GOPROVIDEO.MP4 --atoms # Prints MP4 data strucutre
    geoelan inspect --video GOPROVIDEO.MP4 --meta  # Prints raw udta data and GPMF data if present

GoPro and Garmin telemetry formats

As of GeoELAN v2.0 GoPro Hero 5 Black and newer is supported. There are
significant differences between Garmin's FIT-format and GoPro's
GPMF-format. Here are a few:

                                      Garmin FIT                                                           GoPro GPMF

For performance reasons both GoPro GPMF and Garmin FIT are binary
formats, and thus can't be viewed in a text editor.

Documentation and development

Support for GPMF (GoPro) and FIT (VIRB) formats were written from
scratch for GeoELAN with the help of the official documentation for both
formats.

GoPro

File structure

GoPro recording sessions are split over multiple clips depending on
recording time, quality settings, and SD card size. GoPro provide an
estimate here:
https://community.gopro.com/s/article/GoPro-Camera-File-Chaptering-Information?language=en_US

SD Cards

GoPro cameras use micro SD Cards. GoPro provide recommendations here:
https://community.gopro.com/s/article/microSD-Card-Considerations?language=en_US.

Internal file layout

Since Hero 5 Black all GoPro cameras use a telemetry format called GPMF
developed by GoPro. Currently, the best overview can be found in their
Github repository: https://github.com/gopro/gpmf-parser. (Note that
GeoELAN does not make use of GoPro's parser. Instead, we developed a
GPMF-parser from scratch tailored for our needs).

Garmin VIRB

Note that the Garmin VIRB Ultra 30 is no longer available for purchase.
Garmin currently has no replacement product.

        └── 2017-01-02-12-00-00.fit      May contain data, such as GPS-logs,
                                         for multiple recording sessions.

The VIRB and the FIT-format

To pair and match VIRB video clips belonging to the same recording
sessions with a FIT-file unique identifiers (UUID) are embedded both
within the original video clips and the FIT-files. Preserving these are
key to synchronise and extract relevant GPS-data.

When synchronising and locating data, GeoELAN will sometimes list all
sessions present in the FIT-file. As a help, the number of video clips
and the UUID for the first clip in each session is listed.

A single FIT-file may contain telemetry for multiple recording sessions.
When the camera is turned on, it immediately starts logging data into a
new FIT-file, regardless of a video being recorded or not. The camera
will keep logging to this file until completely turned off. If turned on
again, a new FIT-file will be created. All data points in a FIT-file are
explicitly timestamped, which technically allows synchronisation against
any data type in the file. Further, with the help of the built-in GPS,
absolute timestamps can be derived for all data types. These can be used
for documentation purposes or to synchronise against external data
sources.

For geo-referenced annotations, GeoELAN always embeds absolute
timestamps in the resulting KML-file.

The VIRB cameras split up recording sessions into video clips, each
approximately 10 minutes in length, with no option to turn this off. To
link VIRB video to its corresponding telemetry (e.g. coordinates logged
by the GPS during the recording session), both the clips and the
FIT-file contain UUIDs. When the user starts recording, a "video
recording session start" message is logged to the current FIT-file
together with the UUID embedded in the first clip, denoting the start of
a recording session. Similarly, when recording ends, a "video recording
session end" message is logged together with the UUID embedded in the
last clip in the session. Since all logged FIT-data is timestamped, this
creates a timeline for the session that can be related to any logged
data in the FIT-file.

The VIRB logs location, barometric pressure, and rotation among many
other data types. Since the FIT-format is not a text based data format,
and thus cannot be inspected using a text editor, the inspect command
allows for some exploration of a FIT-file (see command inspect). GeoELAN
will also help out with matching recording sessions to the corresponding
FIT-files (see commands virb2eaf, and locate).

Preserving UUIDs

Concatenating or converting the video clips will usually discard the
UUIDs, so the user is advised to save the original video clips. The
inspect command can be used to display the UUID for a specific VIRB
MP4-file, just run geoelan inspect --video VIRBVIDEO.MP4 with no other
options.

Most of the commands allow for selecting UUID from those present in the
relevant FIT-file when matching files or geo-referencing annotations.
The locate command can also be used to locate all files for a specific
session.

Video file management and options

On the VIRB MicroSD card, the low-resolution clips have a .GLV
extension. These are generated by the VIRB for quick viewing on the
internal camera display. If available, GeoELAN will prefer to link these
in the ELAN-file over the high-resolution video due to their smaller
size (both resolutions will still be concatenated by default). GeoELAN
will not be able to identify the low-resolution .GLV as such if renamed
to .MP4 and they may even be mistaken for the high-resolution versions.
If you only require the low-resolution videos to be concatenated, use
the --low-res-only flag when running virb2eaf. This will ignore the
high-resolution .MP4-files as a concatenation target, with an option to
copy these as-is (--copy) to the output directory (see the virb2eaf
section for further information).

FFmpeg

The gopro2eaf and virb2eaf sub-commands require FFmpeg for concatenating
MP4-clips and to extract the audio track as a WAV-file (required to
display a wave form in ELAN while annotating).

The video and audio streams are by default only concatenated, not
converted, to avoid data loss and to save time, but note that VIRB UUID
and GoPro telemetry will still be discarded - save the original files.
See the virb2eaf section for more information.

There are two main options for installing FFmpeg:

1.  Download the static build of FFmpeg, and specify its path using the
    --ffmpeg option
2.  Install via a package manager. FFmpeg will be automatically
    available to cam2eaf in this case.

  Static build The static build option means that the relevant media
  codecs are included in a single, executable file that can be used as
  is. The FFmpeg download page provides links to static builds for
  macOS, Windows and Linux. Put the downloaded ffmpeg-file in a
  convenient location and use the --ffmpeg option when running gopro2eaf
  or virb2eaf. Optionally moving or symlinking this file to a directory
  in PATH will yield the same result as using a package manager below.

  Package manager Installing via a package manager means the ffmpeg
  command can be executed from anywhere in a terminal. Linux
  distributions usually come with one pre-installed. For macOS Homebrew
  is a popular choice, whereas Windows has Chocolatey (or WSL). This
  option means you do not have to specify the location of ffmpeg each
  time gopro2eaf or virb2eaf is run. If a package manager is not for
  you, go with the static build for your platform.

ELAN

ELAN is a completely free, advanced application for time-aligned
annotations of audiovisual media developed by the The Language Archive,
Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen. While it is
well-known in academia, and particularly in the humanities for
transcribing recordings, its use goes well beyond this, since anything
observed can be annotated, and thus time-aligned (GeoELAN is but one
example). Since annotations are kept aligned in parallel on separate
tiers - as many as required, similar to multi-track audio editors - the
possibilites are almost endless. The ELAN Annotation Format is XML-based
which makes it both human-readable and fairly straightforward to parse.

GeoELAN Rust crates

GeoELAN is written in Rust and uses three custom libraries (aka crates)
that were developed from scratch in parallel with the tool itself. This
was partly due to the need to get to know the formats better, but mainly
because the only existing option was to create bindings to existing
libraries in several other programming languages. Since these Rust
crates are still in development they are not yet available on crates.io,
but can if needed be copied from the GeoELAN source and used with the
Apache 2.0 license attached to GeoELAN until released properly.

Three crates were developed for GeoELAN:

-   eaf-rs: Read, write, and process EAF-files. Uses quick-xml and its
    serialization support via serde.
-   gpmf-rs: Read GoPro GPMF-files. Either directly from GoPro
    MP4-files, or "raw" GPMF-files (e.g. a track extracted to file with
    FFmpeg).
-   fit-rs: Read Garmin FIT-files. Supports custom developer messages.
    Some added bloat due to VIRB-specific functionality that seemed
    better to include in fit-rs directly.
-   mp4iter: A simple crate to move around, search atoms on FourCC, and
    read values in an MP4 container. Includes finding byte offsets for
    tracks (trak) via atom hdlr component name, and deriving duration
    for the longest track. This crate does not (and will not) support
    any kind of media en/decoding. See
    https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF
    for more information on the QuickTime/MP4 container.

Data extracted with both gpmf-rs and fit-rs will mostly require further
processing. Support for this is built-in for some data types (e.g. GPS
data, since this is fundamental for GeoELAN), but for others you will
have to develop and expand on this yourself. A first pass, extracting
and parsing data, should always work for both crates. GeoELAN's inspect
command with the --verbose flag prints data in this "raw" form.
